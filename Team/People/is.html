            <h3>Makes good music</h3>
            <P>Around 8th grade I made a fork of the Colored Sprites mod called the Better graphics mod for Undertale. I ended up using a trial version of fl studio to apply realistic soundfonts to midi files of the games music. In doing so I learned how to use some more advanced programs and gained an interest for music , art , photo/video editing etc.. I started making original music around the second semester of my freshmen year at high school not knowing much about music. Now I try to improve and learn new things with most projects. I joined the team because I wanted be in a team where everyone can work together to make something cool. (and because it would be cool to make videogame music for real)</P>
