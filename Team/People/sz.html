            <h3>Writer & great at coming up with vast and expansive lore</h3>
            <P>Team Gelatin's - Should-Be - lead writer, and part-time concept artist. Badger enthusiast (as seen in the photograph), and what's more, owner of the craziest hair this side of the Mississippi. When T.G. gets an office building, he will squat in the corner, slamming bottle after bottle of Coke, and typing hard and fast on his typewriter to finish the next bit of scripting fore the deadline, local rock stations blasting full-volume all night long. Has a soft spot for making his writings a bit sarcastically funny - like <i>you</i> need to know that - to help add a slightly satirical spin on the games, and able to think of vastly-scoped, expansive universes and lore. He hopes to retire to a log cabin in upstate New York when he's just an old bag of bones.</P>
