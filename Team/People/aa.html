            <P>People have said I am like Light (Kira) from death note. Charming, social, really attractive, fiercely intelligent and a bit sociopathic. There is this girl at school who I keep on trying to make interested in me but she doesn't react in the way you would think...
<br /><br />
Im far more intelligent than the other guys in my grade at highschool so they tend to avoid me (typical humans, avoiding what the can't understand / feel inferior to) and generally girls are interested in me because that makes me seem distant and mysterious, I know this because they stare at me often.
<br /><br />
Have you ever played assassins creed? Basically in that game when the protagonist walks through a crowd of people he puts his hands on people and pushes them aside gently and it's really cool. I've been trying to imitate it in real life and people just look at me weird when I touch them on the shoulders and crap.
<br /><br />
I also hint at things in conversations when she's in earshot like "yeah I took him out" and "yeah I sold him like 20 for 10 dollars each" to make her think I'm into something illegal and get her to think I am a bad boy.
<br /><br />
I've seriously had it up to here with this stupid thot and her obnoxious desire to just ignore me at all corners, I'll start having to be a bit more upfront and forceful if she keeps this up, you can't say she doesn't deserve it at this point.
<br /><br />
Any advice appreciated, doubt any of you will be able to come up with anything I don't know already though.</P>
